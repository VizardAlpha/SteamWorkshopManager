# Steam Workshop Manager

Built with .NET 10 and Avalonia UI, it works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.


Features:
- Smart updates: Change title, description, tags, or visibility without re-uploading your mod content or preview image. The app tracks file path, size, and modification date: only uploads when something actually changed!
- Multi-game support: Manage mods for multiple Steam games (switch between workshops easily)
- Visual editor: Edit title, description, tags, and preview image
- Drag & drop: Simply drop your mod folder to create a new item
- Changelog management: add changelogs with each update
- Auto-fetched tags: Workshop tags are automatically retrieved for each game
- Custom tags: Add your own tags per game
- Multi-language: English and French supported
